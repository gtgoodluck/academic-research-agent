# 🎓 Academic Research Agent - Complete Tutorial

## Course Overview
Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on building an AI-powered Academic Research Agent! By the end of this course, you'll understand how to create an intelligent system that can search Google Scholar, analyze research papers, and provide insights using **multiple LLM providers** including Ollama (local), OpenAI (cloud), and Anthropic (cloud).

---

## 📚 **Module 1: Understanding the Architecture**

### What We're Building
Our Academic Research Agent is a sophisticated AI system that combines:
- **Web Scraping** (Playwright) - To extract data from Google Scholar
- **Multi-Provider AI** (Ollama/OpenAI/Anthropic) - For intelligent analysis and summarization
- **Agent Framework** (LangChain) - To orchestrate tools and decision-making

### Core Components Overview
```python
class AcademicResearchAgent:
    def __init__(self, provider="ollama", model=None, api_key=None):
        self.provider = provider.lower()
        self.llm = self._initialize_llm(provider, model, api_key)  # Multi-provider AI brain
        self.tools = self._setup_research_tools()                 # Our capabilities
        self.agent = self._create_research_agent()                # Our decision maker
```

**Think of it like this:**
- **LLM** = The brain that thinks and analyzes (now with multiple options!)
- **Tools** = The hands that can perform actions
- **Agent** = The coordinator that decides which tool to use when

---

## 🛠️ **Module 2: Tool Architecture - The Agent's Capabilities**

### Understanding the Tool Pattern
Each tool follows this structure:
```python
Tool(
    name="tool_name",
    description="What this tool does and when to use it",
    func=self._actual_function_that_does_the_work
)
```

### Tool 1: Scholar Search
```python
Tool(
    name="scholar_search",
    description="Search Google Scholar for papers by author name",
    func=self._search_google_scholar
)
```

**What it does:** Acts like a smart librarian that can find all papers by a specific researcher
**When it's used:** When someone asks "Find papers by Geoffrey Hinton"
**How it works:** Uses web automation to query Google Scholar and extract results

### Tool 2: Paper Analyzer
```python
Tool(
    name="paper_analyzer", 
    description="Analyze and summarize a research paper from its URL",
    func=self._analyze_paper
)
```

**What it does:** Acts like a research assistant that reads papers and creates summaries
**When it's used:** When someone wants to understand a specific paper in detail
**How it works:** Scrapes paper content and uses AI to generate structured summaries

---

## 🧠 **Module 3: The Agent Brain - Decision Making**

### The ReAct Pattern
Our agent uses the **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting) pattern:

```
Question: Find papers by Yann LeCun
Thought: I need to search for this author's papers
Action: scholar_search
Action Input: Yann LeCun
Observation: Found 5 papers by Yann LeCun...
Thought: Now I should present these to the user
Final Answer: Here are the papers I found...
```

### Agent Prompt Template
```python
prompt_template = """
You are an academic research assistant AI.
Available tools: {tools}
Use this format:
Question: the research question
Thought: think about the best approach  
Action: the action to take
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
Final Answer: Present results to user
"""
```

**Key Insight:** The agent doesn't just execute commands - it *thinks* about what to do next based on the results it gets.

---

## 🕷️ **Module 4: Web Scraping with Playwright**

### Why Playwright?
- **Dynamic Content:** Google Scholar loads content with JavaScript
- **Reliability:** More stable than simple HTTP requests
- **Browser Automation:** Can handle complex interactions

### Core Scraping Pattern
```python
with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)  # Invisible browser
    page = browser.new_page()                   # New tab
    page.goto(search_url)                       # Navigate to page
    page.wait_for_selector('.gs_rt')            # Wait for results
    results = page.query_selector_all('.gs_r')  # Extract elements
    browser.close()                             # Clean up
```

### Smart Filtering Logic
```python
# Check if paper is actually by the searched author
author_name_parts = author_name.lower().split()
name_variations = [
    author_name.lower(),                    # "geoffrey hinton"
    author_name_parts[-1],                  # "hinton" 
    f"{author_name_parts[0][0]} {author_name_parts[-1]}"  # "g hinton"
]
is_relevant = any(variation in author_text_lower for variation in name_variations)
```

**Why This Matters:** Academic names can appear in many formats, so we need flexible matching.

## 🤖 **Module 5: Multi-Provider AI Integration**

### Provider Options
Our agent now supports three different AI providers:

| Provider | Type | Cost | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Ollama** | Local | Free | Privacy, Learning, Offline Use |
| **OpenAI** | Cloud | Paid | High Performance, Production |
| **Anthropic** | Cloud | Paid | Safety, Complex Analysis |

### Provider Initialization
```python
# Method 1: Direct initialization
agent = AcademicResearchAgent(provider="ollama", model="llama3.2")
agent = AcademicResearchAgent(provider="openai", model="gpt-4", api_key="your-key")
agent = AcademicResearchAgent(provider="anthropic", model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229")

# Method 2: Convenience methods
agent = AcademicResearchAgent.create_ollama_agent(model="llama3.2")
agent = AcademicResearchAgent.create_openai_agent(model="gpt-4")
agent = AcademicResearchAgent.create_anthropic_agent()
```

### Dynamic Provider Selection
```python
def _initialize_llm(self, provider: str, model: str = None, api_key: str = None):
    """Initialize LLM based on provider"""
    if provider == "ollama":
        from langchain_community.llms import Ollama
        return Ollama(model=model or "llama3.2", temperature=0.1)
    
    elif provider == "openai":
        from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
        return ChatOpenAI(
            model=model or "gpt-4",
            temperature=0.1,
            openai_api_key=api_key or os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        )
    
    elif provider == "anthropic":
        from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
        return ChatAnthropic(
            model=model or "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
            temperature=0.1,
            anthropic_api_key=api_key or os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
        )
```

### Environment Variables for Security
```python
# Load API keys securely
try:
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv()
except ImportError:
    print("⚠️ python-dotenv not installed. Use environment variables.")

# Access keys safely
openai_key = api_key or os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
anthropic_key = api_key or os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

### Paper Analysis Prompt
```python
summary_prompt = f"""
Analyze this research paper content and provide:
1. Main research question/problem
2. Key methodology or approach  
3. Major findings/contributions
4. Significance to the field

Content: {content}
"""
```

**Prompt Engineering Tip:** Structure your prompts with clear, numbered instructions for consistent results.

## 🔄 **Module 6: Interactive User Experience**

### Interactive Provider Selection
```python
def demo_research_agent():
    # Provider selection
    print("\n🔧 **Choose your AI provider:**")
    print("1. 🦙 Ollama (Local, Free)")
    print("2. 🤖 OpenAI (Cloud, Paid)")
    print("3. 🧠 Anthropic (Cloud, Paid)")
    
    provider_choice = input("\nSelect provider (1-3): ").strip()
    
    if provider_choice == "1":
        agent = AcademicResearchAgent.create_ollama_agent()
    elif provider_choice == "2":
        agent = AcademicResearchAgent.create_openai_agent()
    elif provider_choice == "3":
        agent = AcademicResearchAgent.create_anthropic_agent()
```

### Error Handling Strategy
```python
try:
    # Attempt operation
    result = self.agent_executor.invoke({"input": query})
    return {"status": "success", "findings": result}
except Exception as e:
    return {"status": "failed", "error": str(e)}
```

**Best Practice:** Always return structured responses so the calling code knows what happened.

---

## 📊 **Module 7: Content Extraction Techniques**

### Multi-Strategy Content Extraction
```python
content_selectors = [
    '.ltx_abstract',  # arXiv papers
    '#abstract',      # Journal papers  
    '.abstract',      # Generic abstracts
    'article p',      # Article paragraphs
    'p'               # Fallback: any paragraphs
]
```

**Why Multiple Selectors?** Different websites structure content differently. We try specific selectors first, then fall back to more general ones.

### Content Quality Control
```python
for element in elements[:5]:  # Only first 5 elements
    text = element.inner_text().strip()
    if len(text) > 50:  # Only substantial content
        extracted_content += f"{text}\n\n"
        
return extracted_content[:1500]  # Limit total length
```

**Performance Tip:** Limit content extraction to prevent overwhelming the AI and reduce processing time.

---

## 🎯 **Module 8: Demo Modes and Use Cases**

### 1. Single Research Demo
```python
def demo_research_agent():
    researcher_name = input("Enter researcher name: ")
    results = agent.research_papers_interactive(researcher_name)
```
**Use Case:** One-off research for personal learning

### 2. Interactive Research Mode  
```python
def interactive_research_mode():
    while True:
        researcher_name = input("Enter researcher name (or 'quit'): ")
        if researcher_name.lower() == 'quit':
            break
        # Process research...
```
**Use Case:** Extended research sessions, comparing multiple researchers

### 3. Lecture Demo Mode
```python
def lecture_demo_mode():
    print("Ask your audience: 'Which AI researcher should we investigate?'")
    researcher_name = input("Enter audience suggestion: ")
    # Interactive demo with audience participation prompts
```
**Use Case:** Educational demonstrations, conference presentations

---

## 🔧 **Module 9: Advanced Features and Customization**

### Fallback Search Strategy
```python
def _search_google_scholar_broad(self, author_name: str):
    # If precise search fails, try broader search
    search_url = f'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q={author_name}'
    # Less strict filtering for edge cases
```

### Timing and Performance Tracking
```python
start_time = time.time()
# ... do research work ...
elapsed = time.time() - start_time
return {"research_time": elapsed}
```

### Status Reporting
```python
return {
    "findings": final_results,
    "research_time": elapsed, 
    "status": "research_complete"  # or "no_papers_found", "research_failed"
}
```
